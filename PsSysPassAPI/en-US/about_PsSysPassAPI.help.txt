    PsSysPassAPI

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The PsSysPassAPI module provides a wrapper for the sysPass ReSt API.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Using this module is fairly straightforward:

    - Use the Connect-SysPass cmdlet to provide connection and credential
    information to the session
    - Use Find-SysPassAccount ti find details of the account(s) you are trying
    to get the password(s) for.
    - Use Get-SysPassAccountPassword to retrieve the actual password for a given
    account.

    There are additional Find-* cmdlets to help refine searches using the
    Find-SysPassAccount cmdlet.
